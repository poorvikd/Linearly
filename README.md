Linearly was developed with the aim to help students better understand the working of commonly used algorithms. Developed using HTML, CSS , Javascript and Python, the website supports the visualization of eleven different algorithms encompassing sorting searching and graph algorithms.
With the help of random and custom inputs students can better understand the time complexity of these popular algorithms.
The platform's frontend is developed using HTML and CSS, while the visualizations are enabled using a JS library called p5.js and finally the backend is powered by django python. This website also demonstrates the seamless integration of different stacks to build a functioning and complex website.
